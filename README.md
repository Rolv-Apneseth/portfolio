## Description

My personal developer portfolio, built from scratch using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which can be found at [rolvapneseth.com](https://rolvapneseth.com)

## Tools/Technologies

-   [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for all styling, divided into modules to keep the code more manageable
-   [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) for custom scroll animations
-   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and continous deployment
