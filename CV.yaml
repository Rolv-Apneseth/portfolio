            security clients globally in a more accessible format.
          - Collaborated closely with the senior developer in charge of the project on architectural
            decisions, ensuring seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems. In
            addition, conducted thorough code reviews for back-end changes, both to identify potential
            bugs and to remain up-to-date on relevant functionality.
          - Built maintainable custom components (e.g. interactive video timeline with events, video overlays
            for motion detection, progress indicators for video import and analysis) using modern
            React and CSS features to minimise complexity while still enhancing user experience.
          - Leveraged Redux for state management and RTKQuery for efficient API handling,
            ensuring scalability and robust debugging capabilities.
          - Developed comprehensive unit tests with Jest and maintain Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines,
            ensuring high code quality and reliability.

    Personal Projects:
      - name: frankfurte-rs
        summary: "*Rust, Clap, Tokio, Reqwest, CI/CD*"
        date: '[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/frankfurter_cli) | [Docs](https://docs.rs/lib_frankfurter) | [Code](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/frankfurte-rs)'
        highlights:
          - Rust library and CLI to interface with Frankfurter, a currency exchange rate API, to
            enable efficient retrieval and processing of exchange rate data via safe and correct bindings.
          - Implemented custom, restrictive types to validate dates and currency values, ensuring
            only valid data is sent to API.
          - Created comprehensive unit and integration tests, including property based tests for
            custom types to ensure they can handle any inputs. Tests are only run against locally
            hosted versions of the API setup via a custom Docker compose file, for efficient
            testing without impacting the public API.

      - name: World Wonders API
        date: '[Demo](https://world-wonders-api.org/v0/docs) | [Code](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/world-wonders-api)'
        summary: "*Rust, Axum, Docker, Open API, CI/CD*"
        highlights:
          - An API written in Rust using Axum, which provides information about famous architectural
            wonders from around the world, created to explore back-end technologies as well as my
            interest in history.
          - Developed a Docker image for seamless self-hosting, accessible via Docker Hub, and
            provided detailed documentation through a web page along with an OpenAPI specification.
          - Automated CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions, including running unit and integration test, rebuilding the Docker image, and deploying it to the VPS, leading to an improved developer experience with a one-step deployment process.

      - name: ps-typer
        summary: "*Python, PyQt5, PyQtGraph, NLTK, SQLite*"
        date: '[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ps-typer/) | [Code](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/ps-typer)'
        highlights:
          - A GUI application written in Python using PyQt5, made for practising typing with a modern, minimalistic UI, made using the PyQt5 library for Python. I used this application to go from 40 WPM to 85 WPM and continue to use it to this day.
          - Leveraged various corpora of text from the NLTK library to generate near endless content of full, proper sentences for a user to practice typing with. This was one of my main goals in creating this project.
          - Implemented a user statistics system with the use of a local SQLite3 database, so that users can track the progression of their typing speeds. The results are visualised using PyQtGraph for easy consumption.

      # - name: rofi-games
      #   summary: "*Rust, Nom*"
      #   date: '[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/lib_game_detector) | [Code](https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/rofi-games)'
      #   highlights:
      #     - A plugin for the Rofi application launcher on Linux, written in Rust, which adds a mode for
      #       neatly displaying and launching games available from multiple sources on a user's system.
      #       It saves users time launching or modifying games on their system by avoiding navigating
      #       cluttered and resource-intensive game launcher UIs.
      #     - Extracted the core parsing logic into a separate Rust library to make that functionality
      #       widely available to other developers.
      #     - Designed the library to efficiently parse games at runtime from various configuration
      #       files for common game sources, such as Steam or Lutris, using the nom parser combinator
      #       library. This allows users to access their entire gaming collection in a single, light-weight
      #       launcher which takes milliseconds to detect and display all their games.
      #     - Extended customisability by supporting a configuration file for modifying parsed entries
      #       and defining entirely custom ones, allowing users to personalise and extend the available
      #       options for the launcher to their liking.
